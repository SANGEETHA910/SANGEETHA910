		<p>He was born in time when learning programming itself was big challenge.</p>

		<p>By age of 13, Bill showed deep interest in coding. He used to dig through the codes from trash cans of the computer centres and studies those.</p>

		<p>At school, he met Paul Allen and they bonded over a common interest in computers.</p>

		<p>Soon, they began skipping classes to work in school's computer room.</p>

		<p>One day, Gates saw a new computer on the cover of a magazine that just came out in the market. Bill knew that it was an opportunity of a lifetime to build a software for them before anyone else did.</p> 

		<p>So, Bill called that company and told them that he had a software ready for their computer. But it was just to gain their interest and he had not written even a single line of code for that.</p>

		<p>His passion and belief in his skills was so much that he was willing to risk his future at Harvard for that opportunity.</p>

		<p>It evolved into Microsoft windows which took over the whole world making Gates a billionaire at 31.</p>

		<p>Today, Bill Gates is the richest man in the world and has net worth of 90 billion.</p>

		<p>His story teaches us that do not be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try.</p>
